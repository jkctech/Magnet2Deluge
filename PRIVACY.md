# Privacy Policy for Magnet2Deluge

**Last updated:** July 2025

## Overview

Magnet2Deluge is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed with privacy-first principles and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal information.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your device and does not:
- Track your browsing activity
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Send data to external servers
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Monitor which websites you visit

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
All data is stored locally on your device using your browser's built-in storage system:

- **Deluge URL**: Your Deluge Web UI address (e.g., `http://localhost:8112`)
- **Deluge Password**: Your Deluge authentication password
- **Settings**: Extension preferences like direct click detection

This data is stored in your browser's sync storage and is only accessible to the extension itself.

## Data Transmission

### To Deluge Only
The only external communication the extension performs is:

- **Deluge Authentication**: Your password is sent to your Deluge instance for login
- **Magnet Links**: Magnet URLs are sent to your Deluge instance to add torrents

These communications are:
- Direct to your Deluge server only
- Not logged or stored by the extension
- Encrypted if using HTTPS
- Never sent to any third-party servers

## Third-Party Services

**No third-party services are used.**

The extension does not integrate with:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Cloud storage services
- Any external APIs except your Deluge instance

## Browser Permissions

The extension requests these permissions:

- **Storage**: To save your Deluge settings locally
- **Context Menus**: To add right-click options for magnet links
- **All URLs**: To detect magnet links on any website

These permissions are standard for browser extensions and do not enable data collection.

## Data Retention

- **Local Settings**: Stored until you uninstall the extension or clear browser data
- **No Server Logs**: We don't have servers, so no logs are created
- **No Analytics**: No usage data is collected or retained

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access**: View all stored data in your browser's extension settings
- **Modify**: Change settings anytime through the extension popup
- **Delete**: Remove all data by uninstalling the extension
- **Export**: No data to export as everything is stored locally

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, changes will be reflected in the extension's version notes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
